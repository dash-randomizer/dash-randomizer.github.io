      <p class="intro">
      On Saturday, November 16 at 6:00 pm ET, a special charity marathon randomizer race will be featured at DreamHack Atlanta. This race will be between <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/zoasty">Zoast</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rossu123">Rossu</a>. <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kipp">Kipp</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/andy">Andy</a> will be on commentary to promote the new DASH Randomizer that Kipp has been working on with others in the community.

<br /><br />
When the race airs, information will be released about how to get seeds to play the randomizer as well as information about a planned one-day tournament with cash prizes that will be featured on SpeedGaming at the beginning of 2020. It is also possible that this tournament will be used to raise funds for the SG Live 2020 Super Metroid randomizer tournament. Additional game modes are also currently in development.

A beta version of the DASH randomizer was featured in a Crowd Control race during SG Live 2019.

      <h2><u>About DASH</u></h2>
      <p class="intro">
         The DASH (Diversity and Selective Haste) Super Metroid Randomizer focuses on providing more options for runners to complete seeds by providing new functionality to Bombs, Spazer Beam, Gravity Suit, and Charge Beam. This randomizer seeks to open up Super Metroid even more by limiting the gating potential of certain items and item locations. DASH utilizes the Total logic from the 2017 Super Metroid Randomizer Tournament with the functionality changes to expand players’ options to defeat bosses and progress through areas of the game.
         <br /><br />
For more information, please watch the three introduction videos that will outline all of the major changes that the DASH Randomizer adds on top of what the Total Randomizer created.
