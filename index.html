      <div id="topic">
         The DASH (Diversity and Selective Haste) Super Metroid Randomizer focuses on providing more options for runners to complete seeds by providing new functionality to Bombs, Spazer Beam, Gravity Suit, and Charge Beam. This randomizer seeks to open up Super Metroid even more by limiting the gating potential of certain items and item locations. DASH utilizes the Total logic from the 2017 Super Metroid Randomizer Tournament with the functionality changes to expand players' options to defeat bosses and progress through areas of the game.
         <br /><br />
For more information, please watch the three introduction videos that will outline all of the major changes that DASH adds on top of what the Total Randomizer created.
